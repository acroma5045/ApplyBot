Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm Harsh Shinde, a recent MCA graduate (7.50 CGPA from TIMSCDR, Mumbai) and Clover Infotech intern (Jan-Jul 2025), passionate about building scalable backend solutions. During my internship, I developed the ACAD Tracking Tool—a Flask-based platform for real-time system metrics (CPU, memory, InnoDB) with RBAC authentication, dynamic dashboards, and cooldown alerts to optimize performance. I also engineered the ACAD Ticketing Tool, featuring RESTful APIs, advanced routing, and agile deployment on RHEL 7.6.

Key Skills & Experience:
- Python & Flask: Backend dev, automation, API integration
- Databases: MySQL/PostgreSQL queries, data validation
- Full-Stack: HTML/CSS/JS for seamless UIs
- Tools: Git, agile methodologies; B.Sc IT (7.77 CGPA)

Eager to bring my hands-on experience to your team at {company_name}—let's discuss how I can contribute to your innovative projects.

Resume attached. Reply to schedule a quick chat?
